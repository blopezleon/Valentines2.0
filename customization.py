Min,

From the moment we met, I knew there was something special about you. Every day with you feels like winning the jackpot - not because of luck, but because I get to share my life with someone as amazing as you.

This Valentine's Day, I wanted to do something that shows how much thought and effort I'm willing to put into making you smile. You deserve someone who goes all-in, and that's exactly what I'm doing - going all-in on us.

I can't wait for our date and for all the adventures still to come. You're my player 2, my perfect combo, my jackpot.

Love always,
[Your Name]
